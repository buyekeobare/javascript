Next, we want you to implement a slider control to allow the user to choose a maximum number of people to invite to their party.

Implement a basic slider control to go along with the provided label.
Give it a minimum value of 1, maximum value of 30, initial value of 10 and element id of max-invite.
Create a corresponding output element to put the current value of the slider into. Give it a class of invite-output, and semantically associate it with the input. If you do this correctly, the JavaScript included on the page will automatically update the output value when the slider is moved.
